This is a Cinnamon desktop applet that displays an animated cat in your panel to indicate CPU usage. The faster the cat runs, the higher the CPU load.

## About

This project is a port of the popular [RunCat](https://github.com/Kyome22/RunCat_for_windows) utility to the Cinnamon desktop environment. It provides a simple, fun, and visual way to keep an eye on your system's performance.

## Features

-   **Animated CPU Indicator**: An animated cat runs in your panel, with its speed directly corresponding to your current CPU usage.
-   **Idle State**: When CPU usage is below a configurable threshold, the cat will be in a resting state.
-   **Customizable Display**: You can choose to display the animation, the CPU percentage, or both.
-   **Configurable Settings**: Easily adjust the idle threshold and other options through the applet's settings.

## Installation
